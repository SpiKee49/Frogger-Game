# Frogger-Game

## Project
Create a simple, interactive game that includes text, picture, sound, and is controlled by the keyboard and /
or mouse. The game must have a goal, be playable and have an end (eg whether I won or lost, what score I
got, etc.) The game should be reasonably challenging.

## Conditions
- Implement the game from the list below.
- Implementation in HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.
- Control, presentation and model parts must be strictly separated.
- It is forbidden to use complex game libraries and frameworks.
- Each student solves a different game

- 2p) Design all game screens and menu
- 1p) Description of the basic goals and functioning of the game
- 3p) Design of all game screens and menus
- 4p) OOP description of objects in the game (classes, their attributes and methods)
### CHP2 - documentation with prepared documents: 3p
- 3p) graphic and sound elements of the game
- add to the documentation submitted in CHP1
### CHP3 – handover and demonstration of the game in progress: 7p
- Menu and additional screens
- 1p) Main menu implemented.
